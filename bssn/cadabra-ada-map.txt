The following lines record the progression of symbol names from the Cadabra source to the
final Ada code. Each line documents a single object.

The changes are required to accomodate the syntactic limitations of the various languages.
Cadabra use a LaTeX like syntax for tensors that is not supported in Python and Ada. The
first stage of the translation is to export the Cadabra names to Python. Though Python
does understand the underscore symbol, it appears that the current version of Cadabra
(2.1.9) does not support underscores in Python names (presumably because the underscore
is reserved exclusively for tensor subscripts). As tempting as it might be to create a
Python symbol such as N_ab for the second derivatives of N this will cause Cadabra much
grief. In contrast, Ada is quite happy to accept underscores in symbol names. So I have
introduced the underscore in the Ada names to separate the object name from the tensor
indices. Note that this use of underscore does not denote subscripts but rather as way to
separate the object name from the indices. Python does not understand \partial so I have
chosen the "d" symbol to denote partial derivatives.

Note that the intermediate symbols are not all that important. The important symbols are
the Cadabra (first) and Ada (last) symbols.
