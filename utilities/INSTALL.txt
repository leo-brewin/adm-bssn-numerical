The Ada file cdb2ada must be compiled and installed before any of the ADM or BSSN codes can be compiled.

Once the Ada compiler is installed you can compile the Ada files in this directory by running

   build.sh

This is a shell script that executes just one command

   gprbuild -p -P build.gpr

This fires up the Ada compiler and writes the binaries to the ./bin directory.

Copy ./bin/* to somewhere on your $PATH. That's it, all done for the Ada tools.

You can test the binaries by running

   cdb2ada -h

This should give you simple help messages.
