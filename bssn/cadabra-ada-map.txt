The following lines record the progression of symbol names from the Cadabra source to the
final Ada code. Each line documents a single object.

The changes are required to accomodate the syntactic limitations of the various languages.
Cadabra use a LaTeX like syntax for tensors that is not supported in Python and Ada. The
first stage of the translation is to export the Cadabra names to Python. Though Python
does understand the underscore symbol, it appears that the current version of Cadabra
(2.1.9) does not support underscores in Python names (presumably because the underscore
is reserved exclusively for tensor subscripts). As tempting as it might be to create a
Python symbol such as N_ab for the second derivatives of N this will cause Cadabra much
grief. In contrast, Ada is quite happy to accept underscores in symbol names. So I have
introduced the underscore in the Ada names to separate the object name from the tensor
indices. Note that this use of underscore does not denote subscripts but rather as way to
separate the object name from the indices. Python does not understand \partial so I have
chosen the "d" symbol to denote partial derivatives.

Note that the intermediate symbols are not all that important. The important symbols are
the Cadabra (first) and Ada (last) symbols.

Note also that all symmetric 3x3 matrics are stored in 1-dimensional arrays.
This is done using Ada's type system. A symmetric type is created using

   type symmetric is (xx,xy,xz,yy,yz,zz);  -- for symmetric 3x3 arrays

An Ada type for the metric at a point is then defined using

   type MetricPointArray is Array (symmetric) of Real;

An object of that type is created using

   gab : MetricPointArray;

The components of gab can be accessed using gab(xx) for g_ab(x,x) and gab(xy) for g_ab(x,y) etc.

More types are created that allow objects to be stored at all grid points on a 3-dimensional grid.
So the 3d metric on the grid (not just at a point) can be accessed using

   gab (i,j,k)(xx) or gab (i,j,k)(xz) etc.

where (i,j,k) are the indices of the grid point.

The full definitions of these types and their use in defining objects of those types can be found
in

   adm/ocde/src/admbase.ads
   bssn/code/src/bssnnase.ads

The type system is one of Ada's strengths. It's extremely useful in making sure that 'apples' and
'oranges' are never accidentally mixed (so easy to do in C and Fortran and often very hard to track down).
